I was invited to represent [ABMI](http://www.abmi.ca) at the  
*Multi-taxa Monitoring in North America* symposium, North American Congress
for Conservation Biology, Madison, Wisconsin, July 18, 2016.
The symposium was organized by Michael Lucid (Idaho Department of Fish and Game).
It was great to see all the good work happening in North America, and
the commitment to push the agenda of multi-taxa monitoring
against critics and scarce funding (of course Alberta 'has all the oil money').

I was also busy with the pre-congress course on
[*Hierarchical models*](http://peter.solymos.org/etc/2016/02/25/hierarchical-models-for-conservation-biologists-made-easy.html) with Subhash Lele, and the post-congress workshop on
*Integrating Science, Management, and Policy to Conserve North American Boreal Birds*
organized by Marcel Darveau, Steve Cumming, and Nicole Barker.
Cheese-curds, good company, fine dining, cool beer, and lots of conservation science.
What else to wish for?

Here are my slides from the multi-taxa monitoring symposium:
