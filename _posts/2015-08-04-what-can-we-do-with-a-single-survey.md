We presented a poster at the [ICCB/ECCB 2015 congress](http://http://www.iccb-eccb2015.org/) in Montpellier, France, that summarized our research on single visit methodology.

We showed that if information on habitat covariates that affect occupancy/abundance and detection are collected, then one can estimate detection probability as well as occupancy/abundance parameters.

and the poster made with [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/):

Organizers wanted the poster sessions to be interactive.
But posters are hung up much longer than the actual poster session.
What can be done to make posters interactive in the absence of a presenter?
This gave the idea to mimic a blog post, both in style and in structure.
I added space for comments and created a mini poll, left out a marker
on a string, and waited for the results.

Survey responses were mostly positive, which is good. 
But the best of all was a cute little girl who was thrilled
at the notion of drawing onto the poster. Thanks for the feedback!
