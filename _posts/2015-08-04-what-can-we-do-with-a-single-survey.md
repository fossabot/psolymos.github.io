We presented a poster at the [ICCB/ECCB 2015 congress](http://http://www.iccb-eccb2015.org/) in Montpellier, France, that summarized our research on single visit methodology.

We showed that if information on habitat covariates that affect occupancy/abundance and detection are collected, then one can estimate detection probability as well as occupancy/abundance parameters.
