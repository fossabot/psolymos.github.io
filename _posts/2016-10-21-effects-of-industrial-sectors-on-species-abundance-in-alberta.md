Please see the latest issue of the ABMI's Science Letters, "Effects of Industrial Sectors on Species Abundance in Alberta".

In this issue, we explore the ABMI's data on human footprint (the visible transformation of native ecosystems by human activities) and its effects on Alberta's biodiversity. These data are freely available on our website, abmi.ca. Using examples, we illustrate how the data can be used to assess the effects of specific industrial sectors—forestry, agriculture, transportation, and so on—on species of interest. Sector effect estimates take into account not only the amount of human footprint, but also what habitat types a sector’s footprint impacts the most. These estimates thus provide tools for exploring alternative management options in land-use planning, which we hope will be of value to land managers province-wide.
