It all started with my site based on the
[SinglePaged](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged)
theme broken by the [Jekyll 3.0 update on GitHub pages](https://github.com/blog/2100-github-pages-now-faster-and-simpler-with-jekyll-3-0).
Although [Karthik Raman](https://github.com/karthikraman) sent a
nice [pull request](https://github.com/psolymos/psolymos.github.io/issues/1) with a fix,
I opted to revamp my site instead of fixing the old theme.

I really liked the old theme, but there were several reasons for the change:

* Single paged theme made it hard to see in [Google analytics](www.google.com/analytics) who is looking what on the site, because seemingly everyone looked at `index.html`.
* After a while, I wanted real blog and subpages, and I felt more comfortable tweaking [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)/[Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) based themes
after having spent some time last summer setting up [DataCloning.org](http://datacloning.org) and [species.abmi.ca](http://species.abmi.ca).
* I also had a [web-update repo](https://github.com/psolymos/web-update) in the works, so transitioning was really easy (although migrating content and fine tuning took 3 days).

So here is the result. Let me know if you have comments, suggestions.
Hopefully the [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) widget loads properly below.
