One-day teaching workshop at ICCB/ECCB congress in Monpellier on August 1st, 2015.

This training course is aimed towards the conservation professionals who need
to understand and feel comfortable with modern statistical and computational
tools used to address pressing conservation issues.

By presenting both Bayesian and Likelihood based approaches,
the participants will be able to go beyond the rhetorics of philosophy
of statistics and use the tools with full understanding of their
assumptions and implications.
