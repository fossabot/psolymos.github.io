We showed that if information on habitat covariates that affect occupancy/abundance and detection are collected, then one can estimate detection probability as well as occupancy/abundance parameters. <br/><br/><strong><a href='http://figshare.com/articles/Occupancy_and_Abundance_estimation_in_the_presence_of_detection_error_What_can_we_do_with_a_single_survey_/1495329'>Poster</a>, <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18096698/iccb2015-solymos-poster-references.zip'>reprints</a>.</strong>"
