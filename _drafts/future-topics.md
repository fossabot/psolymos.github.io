 goal: increase awareness (overall work, packages)
 measure:
 * Google analytics metrics:
  - bounce rate
  - visits, visitors, returning
  - time on site, page views per visit
  - inbound links
 * number of Disqus comments
 * Social: number of tweets, RT, followers (shares, mentions)
 * CRAN metrics: downloads
 * number of DC mailing list subscribers
 * adsense metrics (engagement - views)

Acquisition (how I get customers to the site),
engagement (what are they doing on the site),
conversion (are they doing what I want: subscribe, download, fill-in form/poll).
